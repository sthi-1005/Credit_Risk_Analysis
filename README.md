# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview
A credit card risk evaluation program will be created using machine learning with `imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` libraries.

Approach: results from oversampling the dataset will be demonstrated with `RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` algorithims, results from undersampling will be demonstrated using the `ClusterCentroids` algorithm, and a cmoinatrotial approach of over- and undersampling will be demonstrated using the `SMOTEEN` algorithm. Lastly, `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `EasyEnsembleClassifiers` will be used as the final predictive models.
